<!--Project Motivation-->
## Project Motivation
This project will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they like, project is divided into following tasks.
*	Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Exploring data to understand what is required and what can be done with datasets provided.
*   Rank Based recommendations
    * Since there are no ratings provided to articles we need to find most popular articles based on the most user interactions.
*	User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
    * We could look at the users that are simialr in terms of items they have interacted with, these items could be then recommended to the similar users.
*	Matrix Factorization
    * Using user-item interactions matrix decomposition is built and we can predict new articles an individual might interact with.
